# ARAnalysis

Score on any turf. Immerse yourself in a world where there is always a goal. With augmented reality and ARAnalysis, you can place a goal wherever and whenever you need it. ARAnalysis includes high quality virtual soccer and football goals that can be placed, dragged, and resized for whatever occasion arises. Don't have a real ball? ARAnalysis lets you launch high quality virtual soccer balls and footballs towards the virtual goals. Already have a real goal and just want to practice shots from a certain distance away? Use the goal distance feature to mark the goal's location then walk away to whatever distance away on the field you want to practice from. ARAnalysis is also a handy tool to measure the distance between any two points for any purpose using the power of augmented reality.
